# In this function you can add whatever enchantment  from TE+ 
# you want in your "GROUP" item

# For this you can check out in TE+ base datapack following this path:
# "data/technical_anvil/functions/interaction/item_type/<file>"

#There you will find a buch of files in relation with vanilla items
# such as axe, pickaxe, sword, etc...

#You can open each file and copy the exact line of code you want to add to
# your "GROUP"

#Be carefull though, in some cases not all enchantments will work because it is
# hard coded, like: An armor enchantment won't work on a sword item
