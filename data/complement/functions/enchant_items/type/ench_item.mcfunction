#CNTEXT: this function comes from "complement:enchant_items/select_type"

#This function adds all the enchantments that your item can receive,
# there are many contitions to check, but for that you can check out the
# ones in TE+ datapack at "data/enchantplus/functions/loot/enchanting/type/<file>"
# You can open each file and copy the exact command to make that enchantment
# appear when using the enchanting table

#At this point you could even add "Addon Enchantments" to this file, but
# you MUST check if the addon is 100% enabled in the world, so you can
# always safely add it to this function. Otherwise you will get
# bugged items without any custom enchantments
