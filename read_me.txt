====================== What you want to do with your complement! ======================
In case you want to share your complement you have two options:

1.- You can upload it to Planet Minecraft or other platform by yourself

For this, you must provide credit to TE+ Renewed original datapack link, and the link of the mod
that your complement supports.

2.- You can ask me to upload it to TE+ Renewed Orinigal PMC page and add it into the "Complements" section

In this case I of course give you credits as the creator of the complement.
=======================================================================================

                                       WARNING!!!

I'm not responsible for any of the bugs in your complement, I make sure to give clear instructions, so
if something isn't tworking, is not my fault! 

However, if you find bugs that are related to TE+ Renewed original datapack, be sure to tell me and I
will check it out.
=======================================================================================
I highly recommend you to do ONE COMPLEMENT PER MOD, because it is easier to avoid bugs in that way.

This is due to the fact that players may only want one mod from the complement to be supported, and if they
don't install the other mod to work correctly with your complement, a lot of bugs are going to apperar.
