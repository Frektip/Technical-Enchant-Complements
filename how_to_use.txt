====================== TE+ COMPLEMENT TEMPLATE ======================
For this complement to work you MUST have also installed TE+ original datapack
=====================================================================

1.- [What you can change]
You can't change the name or the location of any of the files provided in:
- enchantplus
- technical_anvil
- load

What you need to do in those files is to go to "tags/functions/[file]" and change  ONLY the name "complement" to
to whatever your namespace want to be. 

If you do that, you can change the name of the main folder called "complement" to your namespace

You can also change the pack.png if you want
You can also change the description from the pac.kmcmeta file

2.- [Adding custom enchantments to modded items]

You need to go to "complement/functions/menu/[file]" and follow the instructions

However, there are some CONFLICTS with Slatter, Poison Aspect (for tridents), Waterjet, Agility, Life+ and
Attack Speed (for swords) enchantments. You must do an extra step if you want to add them correctly.

----------------------------------------------------------
2.1.- Poison Aspect for tridents and Waterjet enchantment

These enchantments trigger when you throw the trident and hit an entity, to make this also work for your
modded trident, you must go to:

- "complement/functions/result/poison_aspect_trident"
- "complement/functions/result/waterjet_trident"

Be sure to follow the instructions from these files

----------------------------------------------------------
2.2.- Slatter enchantment

We need to detect when the player right clic with the custom fishing rod, and for that an scoreboard needs
to be created, so go to: "complement/functions/load" and follow the instructions; also is recommended that
you check "complement/functions/uninstall" and follow the instructions.

After you create the scoreboard, go to "complement/functions/result/splatter_trigger" and follow the instructions

----------------------------------------------------------
2.3.- Agility, Life+ and Attack Speed enchantments

Even if you add boots, chestplate or sword in step 2.0, you will only get the Lore from these enchantments into your
boots, chestplate or sword. To add correctly the enchantment, you need to give it an Attribute, and for that go to:

- "complement/functions/merge_attributes/agility_type"
- "complement/functions/merge_attributes/life_plus_type"
- "complement/functions/merge_attributes/attack_speed_type"

Follow precisely the instructions!

3.- [Prevent bugs]

If you add a modded item, you MUST go to "technical_anvil/tags/items/ui", you need to open it and add the id
of all the modded items you add into the complement.

This is very important because otherwise, players can duplicate the output from the Technical Anvil slot!

- You can add more files in the "tags/items" folder depending on your needs, but DON'T remove or change the
  name of "ui" in the folder
