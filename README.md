# Technical-Enchant-Complements
Complements are a nice way to make all of TE+ base datapack enchantments (yes, all 52 of them) complatible with modded items!

In short, complements are other datapacks that need to be loaded alongside with TE+ in order to work properly; also, you need to download the
correct complement your your mod, otherwise the whole datapack is going to break.

This repository contains the neccesary files to start creating your complement, follow the #comments in each file correctly and for beginners read the "read_me.txt" file.

You can find the complements list in the [wiki](https://github.com/Frektip/Technical-Enchant-Complements/wiki)
